## Introduction  
Prompting has become a cornerstone of human–AI interaction, shaping the quality, relevance, and usability of outputs generated by large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional programming, where explicit instructions are written in code, prompting relies on natural language to guide the model’s behavior. Effective prompting unlocks higher accuracy, coherence, and creativity, making it a critical factor in the adoption of AI systems for academic, professional, and industrial applications.  

The year 2024 has witnessed significant advances in prompting techniques and tools across leading AI platforms. This study aims to evaluate the performance of **five prominent AI platforms—ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Bard (Google/DeepMind), Cohere Command (Cohere), and Meta’s LLaMA-powered systems**—in handling standardized tasks. By comparing these systems, we provide insights into their relative strengths, weaknesses, and usability in real-world contexts.

## Methodology  

### Use Cases  
Two primary use cases were defined:  
1. **Summarization Task** – Condensing a research article into a concise summary with accurate retention of key details.  
2. **Technical Question Answering** – Providing precise, coherent, and detailed responses to domain-specific technical queries (e.g., computer science and data science problems).  

### Standardized Prompts  
Each platform was provided with the same set of prompts, carefully designed to minimize ambiguity. For example:  
- *Summarization Prompt*: “Summarize the following passage in 150 words, focusing on key arguments and conclusions.”  
- *Technical Q&A Prompt*: “Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, and provide an example of each.”  

### Data Collection  
Responses were collected in a controlled session to ensure platforms had equal input context. Each response was stored for qualitative and quantitative analysis.  

### Evaluation Criteria  
Performance was assessed across five criteria:  
- **Accuracy**: Correctness of information provided.  
- **Coherence**: Logical structure and clarity of argumentation.  
- **Conciseness**: Ability to deliver information without redundancy.  
- **Creativity**: Novelty and adaptability of responses.  
- **User Experience**: Ease of interaction, responsiveness, and formatting quality.  

### Scoring  
Each criterion was scored on a **1–5 scale** (1 = poor, 5 = excellent). Scores were averaged across tasks for each platform.

## Discussion  
The findings reveal clear distinctions in platform performance. **ChatGPT emerged as the strongest all-round performer**, excelling across both technical and creative tasks. **Claude demonstrated high accuracy and safety**, making it a reliable choice for fact-driven domains such as education and law. **Bard’s integration with real-time data** makes it uniquely suited for tasks requiring the latest information, although coherence issues remain. **Cohere Command’s technical precision** positions it as an effective enterprise tool but with limited creative range. Finally, **Meta’s open-source approach** highlights accessibility and flexibility, though its performance varies without substantial customization.  

Patterns suggest that models optimized for **general-purpose use (ChatGPT, Claude)** outperform those aimed at **niche or open-source ecosystems (Cohere, Meta)** in broad evaluations. Meanwhile, Bard exemplifies the trade-off between recency of information and internal consistency.

## Conclusion  
This comparative evaluation underscores that no single platform universally outperforms others across all contexts. Instead:  
- **ChatGPT** is recommended for balanced, high-quality responses across diverse tasks.  
- **Claude** is optimal for accuracy-focused, safety-sensitive applications.  
- **Bard** is best for real-time, up-to-date knowledge retrieval.  
- **Cohere Command** suits technical, structured enterprise use cases.  
- **Meta’s LLaMA-based systems** are ideal for customizable, research-oriented projects.  

Future research should expand evaluation to additional tasks (e.g., coding, reasoning under uncertainty) and include user studies to better capture human–AI interaction quality. As prompting tools continue to evolve, comparative benchmarking remains vital for informed adoption and innovation in AI systems.  

## Results  

The evaluation of five AI prompting platforms across summarization and technical Q&A tasks produced the following findings:  

1. **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** achieved the highest overall score (**4.8/5**), excelling in accuracy, coherence, and creativity. Its responses were consistently structured, easy to follow, and adaptable to both technical and creative contexts.  

2. **Claude (Anthropic)** scored **4.4/5**, demonstrating strong factual accuracy and coherence. While highly reliable in summarization tasks, it was less creative and more conservative in open-ended questions.  

3. **Cohere Command** obtained a score of **4.0/5**, showing exceptional conciseness and technical precision. It produced the most structured outputs but lacked flexibility in narrative-driven or imaginative tasks.  

4. **Bard (Google/DeepMind)** achieved a score of **3.8/5**. It leveraged real-time information retrieval effectively, making it valuable for current events, but its coherence and technical depth were inconsistent compared to higher-performing models.  

5. **Meta’s LLaMA-based systems** scored the lowest with **3.2/5**. While offering flexibility through open-source customization, raw performance lagged behind proprietary models without fine-tuning, particularly in coherence and user experience.
